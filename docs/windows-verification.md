# Verification against real Windows

This records what was checked against a real Windows target, and the two
symptoms worth recognising again.

## Target

A Windows 10 (build 19041) virtual machine reached over the local network, with
NLA required:

```
192.168.75.130:3389   NLA required (a TLS-only connection is refused with
                      HYBRID_REQUIRED_BY_SERVER, 0x00000005)
```

## What works

Verified end to end, using only this library:

* **NLA / CredSSP** completes, including the version 6 public key binding.
* **The desktop renders**: a full Windows session, taskbar, wallpaper and a
  `Command Prompt` window running `ipconfig`, decoded from RLE bitmap updates.
* **Mouse and keyboard input** reach the session. Clicking the console window
  focuses it, and typing

  ```
  echo HELLO-FROM-GRDP
  ```

  produces the expected output on screen, so modifier keys (the upper case
  letters need shift) and Enter are all delivered correctly.

## Symptom: the server rejects the logon, not the protocol

If CredSSP gets through its public key exchange and then the connection is
reset, the interchange is not at fault. The exact shape is:

* the server announces version 6 and accepts the client's `pubKeyAuth`,
* it answers with a 48 byte seal (signature plus the sealed 32 byte hash),
* the client verifies that reply successfully,
* the client sends its credentials, sends the X.224 connection request, and the
  server answers with `connection reset by peer`.

Steps 1 to 4 are pure NTLM and prove the session keys, the seal format and the
binding hash are all correct. Step 5 is where Windows performs the actual
interactive logon, so a reset at that point means the account may not log on
over Remote Desktop. SMB authenticating with the same credentials does not rule
this out, because SMB only needs a network logon.

On this target the fix was to add the account to the local **Remote Desktop
Users** group. A TLS alert (`remote error: tls: internal error`) instead of a
reset is a different thing and does point at the wire format.

## EGFX is offered, but wrapped

With `Setting.EnableEGFX` the dynamic channel layer negotiates correctly
against Windows (which offers version 3) and the server asks for

```
Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Graphics
```

It then stops sending bitmap updates entirely, so the session renders nothing
until the graphics channel is understood.

The payload is not a bare RDPGFX PDU: every message starts with

```
e0 24 ...
```

which is ZGFX, the RDP 8.0 bulk compression (MS-RDPEGFX 3.1.8): `0xE0` is
`ZGFX_SEGMENTED_SINGLE` and `0x24` is `PACKET_COMPRESSED | RDP8`. So EGFX needs
a ZGFX decompressor before RDPGFX parsing can begin.

Two nearby traps that were checked and are **not** at fault:

* channel data in general is fine against Windows, the clipboard channel parses
  its capabilities and monitor ready PDUs correctly;
* the platform is the legacy path's problem only, `Setting.EnableEGFX` is off by
  default so Windows keeps using bitmap updates.
